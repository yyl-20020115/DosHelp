    <pre class="help-content">You are attempting to create a new element in your program
and have given it a name that is already being used.

For example:
  ■ A CONST statement uses the same name as an existing
    variable.
  ■ A new variable or procedure has the same name as an
    existing procedure.

Starting a variable name with the letters &quot;FN&quot; is another
way to generate this error, because FN is used exclusively
with DEF FN.</pre>
