    <pre class="help-content">An invalid expression has been used to assign a value to a
symbolic constant.

Numeric expressions assigned to symbolic constants can
contain:
   ■ Numeric literals.
   ■ Previously defined symbolic constants.
   ■ Any of the arithmetic or logical operators except
     exponentiation.

String expressions assigned to a symbolic constant may
consist only of a single literal string, enclosed in double
quotation marks.</pre>
