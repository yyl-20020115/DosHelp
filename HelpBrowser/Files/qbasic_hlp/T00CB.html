    <pre class="help-content">Use Paste (or press Shift+Ins) to insert a block of text
from the Clipboard at any point in the active window.

To insert text, place the cursor where you want the text
to be inserted and choose Paste.

To replace one piece of text with another, select the text
to replace and choose Paste.

Tip: To put text on the Clipboard, use Cut or Copy. After
     you insert text using Paste, the Clipboard still
     contains the text, and it can be pasted again.</pre>
