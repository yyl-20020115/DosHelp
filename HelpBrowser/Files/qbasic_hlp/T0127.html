    <pre class="help-content">During an OPEN, MKDIR, CHDIR, or RMDIR operation, the
operating system was unable to make a correct connection
between the path and filename.

In the QBasic environment, make sure the file specification
you entered in the text box is formatted correctly. Any
filename can contain a drive name and a full or partial
path.

This error can also occur when you try to save a file which
would replace an existing read-only file.
