    <pre class="help-content">While paused during debugging (at a breakpoint, etc.),
you made a change that prevents execution from continuing.
You may have redimensioned an array, changed procedure
arguments, or edited some other declarative statement.
Use the dialog box and either:
  ■ Choose &lt;OK&gt; to keep the change and restart the program.
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; to undo the change in your program
