    <pre class="help-content">Before deleting a procedure, the SUBs command verifies that
you want to delete the procedure from the module. Either:
  ■ Choose &lt;OK&gt; to delete the procedure.
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; to stop the deletion, leaving everything
    as it was before you chose the command.</pre>
