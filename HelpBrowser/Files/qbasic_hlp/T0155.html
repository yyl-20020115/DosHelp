    <pre class="help-content">This error can be caused by any of the following:
  ■ More than one DIM statement for the same static
    array.
  ■ An attempt to change the dimensions of a dynamic
    array with a DIM statement without using the ERASE
    statement to deallocate the array first.
  ■ An OPTION BASE statement that occurs after an
    array is dimensioned.</pre>
