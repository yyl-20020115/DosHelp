    <pre class="help-content">Use to turn Syntax Checking on and off. When Syntax
Checking is on, QBasic does the following as you enter
each line of code:
  1. Checks the line for syntax errors.
  2. Formats the line.
  3. Translates the line to executable form if the syntax
     is correct.</pre>
