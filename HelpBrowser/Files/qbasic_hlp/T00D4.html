    <pre class="help-content">Use Repeat Last Find (or press F3) to repeat the search
performed by the most recent Find or Change command.

If no Find or Change command has been executed since you
started QBasic, Repeat Last Find searches for the next
occurrence of:
  ■ The word the cursor is on.
  ■ The word to the cursor&apos;s left, if the cursor isn&apos;t
    on a word.</pre>
