    <pre class="help-content">During remote communications, the receive buffer
overflowed.

The size of the receive buffer is set by the RB option
in the OPEN COM statement. To avoid this error, you can:
  ■ Check the buffer more frequently using the LOC
    function.
  ■ Empty the buffer more often using the INPUT$ function.
